# Capstone Glossary

## Purpose
- The purpose of this repository is to create a glossary for the students who are taking part in the Speech Recognition Capstone Project. 
- The topics discussed in the documentation for this capstone are vast, so with this project, the goal is to make these topics easier to understand.

## Navigation
- The webpages will be rather simple, with each term discussed in alphabetical order, with each having its own page for a description.
- Ideally, each webpage will also have subsections, with the top level providing a very surface-level understanding, with the futher portions going into more intricate detail.
