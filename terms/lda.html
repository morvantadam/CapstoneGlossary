<h1>Linear Discriminant Analysis</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<h3>Linear Discriminant Analysis has been described as a way of taking something represented by two values and processing them down to one. For example, in a chart with X and Y values, two points on it could be distinct, or share X, Y, or both values. With this in mind, the points are measured in relation to a line that runs through the graph. (Rough transcribing of explanation provided by Professor Jonas)</h3>
