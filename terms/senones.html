<h2>Intro</h2>
<h3>- A senone can be interpreted as a piece of a sound. Imagine playing a video and very quickly hitting stop again. That sound can be classified as a senone, and two senones, even if sounding the same, can have different results from them depending on context. (Unverified definition)</h3>
