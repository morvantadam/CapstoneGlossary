<h1>Overfitting</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<h3>- The act of, in relation to training from data, overfitting is the act of relying on the test and example data too strongly to determine the output. The reason why this is detrimental, is that relying too closely on the test data, any additional data tested against it would be less reliable, due to it relying on too many specifics from the test data.<br><br>For example, imagine a robot vs an American from Texas might say "howdy". If the data is overfitted to the robot's pronunciation, then the American's probunciation may be read as invalid.</h3>
