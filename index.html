<h2>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</h2>
<h3>This refers to the practice of using empirical data that we have and are examining to find a value for something that we cannot find or express. For exmaple, in relation to this capstone, using MAP to use the data that we have to infer what word appears if we are unable to parse part of it. For instance, the program may see "Look for Kanses on the m-p" where it would parse the missing portion and complete the word as the word "map". (Unverified definition)</h3>
