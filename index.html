<h1>Term definition</h1>
<h2>Cepstral Mean Normalization (CMN)</h2><h3>Cepstral Mean Normalization is a means to parsing sounds in speech recognition, removing noise contamination to present a cleaner form of audio of the speaker. (Unverified definition)</h3>
<h2>Codeword-Dependent Cepstral Normalization (CDCN)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Convolutional Neural Network Models (CNN Models)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Fixed Codeword-Dependent Cepstral Normalization (FCDCN)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</h2><h3>This refers to the practice of using empirical data that we have and are examining to find a value for something that we cannot find or express. For exmaple, in relation to this capstone, using MAP to use the data that we have to infer what word appears if we are unable to parse part of it.<br><br>For instance, the program may see "Look for Kanses on the m-p" where it would parse the missing portion and complete the word as the word "map". (Unverified definition)</h3>
<h2>Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Overfitting</h2><h3>The act of, in relation to training from data, overfitting is the act of relying on the test and example data too strongly to determine the output. The reason why this is detrimental, is that relying too closely on the test data, any additional data tested against it would be less reliable, due to it relying on too many specifics from the test data.<br><br>For example, imagine a robot vs an American from Texas might say "howdy". If the data is overfitted to the robot's pronunciation, then the American's probunciation may be read as invalid.</h3>
<h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)</h2><h3>The ratio of usable data that can be parsed to unusable noise. (Unverified definition)</h3>
<h2>SNR-Dependent Cepstral Normalization (SDCN)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Vocal Track Length (VTL)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Vocal Track Length Normalization (VTLN)</h2><h3></h3>
<h2>Word Error Rate (WER)</h2><h3>The rate of words that were retrieved from the data but were inconsistent with the transcript. (Unverified definition)</h3>
